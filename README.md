### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is riman. About a deaced before I had an interest in coding. Not a serious one. I just wanted to try a bit as I was younger and like other other younger kid i had time and energy for a side hustle. I tried coding for couple of years going nowhere. And then I left it. 

After almost seven years later, I realized that, learning to code was one of the few great things my life encountered yet. That's why I'm back here.
